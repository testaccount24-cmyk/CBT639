*  4. THE USER TO RUN THIS PROGRAM MUST HAVE ENGOUGH AUTHORITY.       *
*     THE SECURITY SOFTWARE WILL CHECK THE AUTHORITY OF THE USERID    *
*     IF HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE THE MVS COMMAND.               *

* USER GUIDE                                                          *
* ==========                                                          *
*  The SETHOUR will update the current TOD clock by one hour,         *
*  and update CLOCKxx member in current system.                       *
*                                                                     *
*  This is used for time saving at April and October each year.       *
*  The program will issue the SET CLOCK system command to set         *
*  the new clock.                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*  The program will get the current TOD clock from system.            *
*  Depends on the parameter given in EXEC PARM, update the TOD        *
*  clock one hour foreward or backward.                               *
*                                                                     *
*  The date will be also changed at following situations:
*   1. Parameter is one hour foreward and the current hour is 23.     *
*   2. Parameter is one hour backward and the current hour is 00.     *
*  This does not apply for Janurary 1 and December 30 because it      *
*  it will change the year. So DO NOT run this program between        *
*  23PM December 30 and 01AM Janurary 1.                              *
*                                                                     *
*  The program will automatically locate your CLOCKxx member in       *
*  system. Normally the member will be SYS1.PARMLIB(CLOCK00).         *
*  The program will first find the CLOCK suffix xx, and search        *
*  the system PARMLIB PDS given in your LOADxx.                       *
*                                                                     *
*  The TIMEZONE statement in CLOCKxx will be updated according to     *
*  EXEC PARM parameters.                                              *
*  For example, if your current time zone in CLOCKxx member is:       *
*      TIMEZONE W.00.00.00                                            *
*  and you use PARM=AUTO to run this program in April, this           *
*  time zone statement in CLOCKxx will be changed to:                 *
*      TIMEZONE E.01.00.00                                            *
*                                                                     *
*  PARAMETERS                                                         *
*  ----------                                                         *
*  The parameter is given in EXEC PARM. Here are the valid options:   *
*                                                                     *
*  1. +1|SPRING|SUMMER                                                *
*     These options tell program to set clock one hour ahead.         *
*     It can be used in April.                                        *
*                                                                     *
*     Example: Run following step in first Sunday morning in April:   *
*     //* UPDATE TIME BY MOVE FORWARD.  I.E. FROM 2am TO 3am          *
*     //SETCLK  EXEC PGM=SETHOUR,PARM=SUMMER                          *
*                                                                     *
*  2. -1|FALL|AUTUMN|WINTER                                           *
*     These option tell program to set clock one hour back.           *
*     It can be used in October.                                      *
*                                                                     *
*     Example: Run following step in last Sunday morning in October:  *
*     //* UPDATE TIME BY MOVE BACKWARD, I.E. FROM 2am TO 1am          *
*     //SETCLK  EXEC PGM=SETHOUR,PARM=FALL                            *
*                                                                     *
*  3. AUTO                                                            *
*     These option tell program to set clock according to current     *
*     month, as follows:                                              *
*     . If current month is earlier than July (Janurary to June),     *
*       the program will set clock one hour ahead.                    *
*     . If current month is later than June (July to December),       *
*       the program will set clock one hour back.                     *
*                                                                     *
*     AUTO option is useful when you need use the same JCL BATCH      *
*     for both April and October.                                     *
*                                                                     *
*     Example:                                                        *
*     You can use following step to change system clock in            *
*     both April and October.                                         *
*                                                                     *
*     //* update time by according current month                      *
*     //SETCLK  EXEC PGM=SETHOUR,PARM=AUTO                            *
*                                                                     *
*  PERFORMANCE                                                        *
*  -----------                                                        *
*  There will be slight time difference (less than 1 second)          *
*  because TOD clock is changed via MVS command SET CLOCK.            *
*  You should give this TOD change job higher performance goal        *
*  to ensure minimum time difference.                                 *
*                                                                     *
*  To do so, you may need to verify your workload manager to          *
*  ensure the performance will be high enough. If you are running     *
*  workload manager goal mode, you must not run this job in           *
*  discretionary service classes.                                     *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*  CLOCK SENSITIVE SOFTWARE                                           *
*  ------------------------                                           *
*  Because some software products are sensitive to system clock,      *
*  especially when you TOD clock one hour back.                       *
*  You mey need to restart and wait one hour after the new clock      *
*  is set.                                                            *
*                                                                     *
*  To make this procedure automatic, you may use my AUTOIPL package   *
*  to restart these sensitive software. The AUTOIPL can be downloaded *
*  from file #623 in http://www.cbttape.org.                          *
*                                                                     *
