RACF notes from Sam Golob.


Approximate instructions to get RACF permissions for SETHOUR,
SETFALL, SETSPRNG to run (see member $$PROCS for the procs themselves).

Instructions:

Do a   SETROPTS LIST   TSO RACF command, to see if OPERCMDS is an
   active class.  If not.......

Activate the OPERCMDS class:  Issue RACF TSO commands:

SETROPTS RACLIST(OPERCMDS)
SETROPTS CLASSACT(OPERCMDS)
SETROPTS GENERIC(OPERCMDS)

Make userids for the names:  SETHOUR, SETFALL, SETSPRNG
                             Give them a default group of SYS1.

 Note:  If you need to activate the OPERCMDS class, and there was
 some other automated software which did operator commands without
 this class being active (such as NETINIT from File 672), you may
 now have to make new userids for those other procedures too.)

Make an OPERCMDS profile of:
MVS.**

Give group SYS1 the access of ALTER to this profile.

Do a REFRESH of the OPERCMDS class, specifically, for GENERIC and
RACLIST.
